# Specification Quality Checklist: Festival Timeline Management App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, well-formed, and ready for the next phase.

### Details

**Content Quality**: All items passed
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY
- No technical implementation details (frameworks, languages, databases)
- Written from user/business perspective
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not technical metrics)
- 9 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (27 total scenarios)
- 7 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope is clearly defined through user stories and functional requirements
- Key entities documented with attributes and relationships

**Feature Readiness**: All items passed
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover core workflows (create, view, edit, delete, organize, export, collaborate)
- Success criteria directly support measurable business outcomes
- Specification maintains abstraction from implementation

## Notes

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. No updates required.
